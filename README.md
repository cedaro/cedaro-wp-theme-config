# WordPress Theme Configuration

Shared project structure, configuration options, and tasks for our WordPress Themes at Cedaro.

We update this for our particular workflow as needed and it's very likely that your workflow and tools are different, so we don't suggest depending on this module directly. Instead, feel free to fork and adapt it to suit your needs.

Used in conjunction with the [load-project-config](https://github.com/cedaro/load-project-config) module.
